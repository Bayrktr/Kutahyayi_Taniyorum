The soup kitchen, madrasah, prayer room and tomb section of the building, which was built by the Germiyan Bey II Yakup Çelebi in 1411, was restored by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism as the "Tile Museum" and opened to visitors in 1999.
Two rooms are opened with a three-way domed iwan to the middle space with a dome and a fountain. In the tomb section, there is the tomb of Yakup Çelebi II covered with tiles. The waqf inscription of the destroyed madrasah is located to the left of the entrance of the museum. The waqf inscription belonging to II Yakup Çelebi was written in Ottoman Turkish and is shown by historians as one of the oldest Turkish inscriptions written on stone after the Göktürk and Uyghur inscriptions.
In the museum, which is also known as the "Gök Şadırvan" among the people, rare examples of Turkish tile art made in different colors and features from the 14th century until today are exhibited.
