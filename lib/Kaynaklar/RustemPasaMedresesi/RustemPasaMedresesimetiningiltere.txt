The madrasah, which is one of the oldest structures in Kütahya, located on Balıklı Street around the Karagöz Paşa Mosque, was built in 1550 by Rüstem Pasha, who was also the son-in-law of the Grand Vizier of Suleiman the Magnificent. The madrasah building was demolished in the 1930s, only the door section remained standing. The inscription of the madrasah is in the Kütahya Archeology Museum today.
Rüstem Pasha Madrasah was restored by the General Directorate of Foundations in 2005-2006. During the restoration, the madrasah rooms were completed on the basis of the destroyed remains of the madrasah, and the entrance door and the mosque were restored in accordance with their original form.
The masjid section of the Rüstem Pasha Madrasah is currently used by private foundations for social and cultural purposes.
