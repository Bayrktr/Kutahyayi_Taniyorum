It was built in 1796-1797 by the Anatolian Governor of the period, Ali Pasha. It is known that in its first construction, there was a twelve-celled madrasah and a primary school, together with the mosque, and that after a fire, the other buildings, which were built only in accordance with the old characteristics of the mosque, have not survived due to neglect.
Ali Pasha Mosque, which was also maintained and repaired on different dates, is one of the most elegant structures of the Ottoman period with its architectural structure and decorations in the center of the bazaar of KÃ¼tahya.
