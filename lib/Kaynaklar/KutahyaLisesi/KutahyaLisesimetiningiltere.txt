Kütahya High School, which is called “Taş Mektep” by the people in Kütahya, was started to be built under the leadership of Governor Tevfik Pasha during the reign of Sultan Abdulhamid II and opened to education as a High School on January 25, 1890.
A branch of Agriculture High School was opened in 1916-1917 and gave training in this field as well. After serving as a Regimental Command and a Military Hospital during the War of Independence, the High School building, which suffered the pains of the World War II and the armistice period, started its education and training activities again as "Sultani" (High School) in 1922-1923. A while after the opening of the school, Gazi Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, who came to Kütahya, visited Kütahya Sultanisi on March 24, 1923 and had a tea talk with the teachers. He expressed the importance of education by saying: "Two armies are needed. One is the army of soldiers that saves the life of the country, and the other is the army of wisdom that kneads the future of the nation."
The building, which suffered a great fire on December 4, 1933, was repaired and reopened for education in the 1937-1938 academic year. In the following years, due to the increase in the population of the city, a new building was built next to the School, and on March 16, 1964, the foundation day of the teacher schools, it was connected to Taş Mektep and continued its education activities.
