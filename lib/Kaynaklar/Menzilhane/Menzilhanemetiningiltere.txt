In the Ottoman period, Menzilhanes were inns and mansions where caravans and passengers completed their daily walks and spent the night, met their needs, and where postmen changed their horses and guards. Rested horses were kept at the menzils, postmen and messengers would change their tired horses here, run the new horse on the next menzil, or deliver the mail they took to the postman at the other destination and return an incoming mail.
Today, only the inscription door of Menzilhane, which is made entirely of stone and attracts attention with its inscription, remains. The building is located in the alley entered from the east of Dönenler Mosque, opposite the Eğdemir bath
