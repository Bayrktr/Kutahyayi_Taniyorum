It is in the city centre, near the Grand Mosque. It was built in the 14th century as the semahane of the Mevlevihane. This first mevlevi house of Kütahya, which is one of the original examples of early Anatolian Turkish architecture, has survived to our time with the semahane and dervish cells, which have been repaired twice. The building, which is used as a mosque today, has a rectangular plan close to the square and an octagonal pulley. Adjacent to the building, the masjid built by İmadüddin Hezar Dinari, known as the 'Conqueror of Kütahya', became the mausoleum of the Mevlevihane with the burial of Ergun Çelebi, the grandson of Mevlana. It is understood from the inscription on the wall of Semahane that it underwent maintenance and repairs in 1812 and 1841. Semahane, which was closed for a long time after the closure of dervish lodges, was extensively restored and repaired by the General Directorate 
of Foundations and converted into a mosque in 1959. The building, also known as Dönenler Mosque among the people, is one of the most beautiful historical monuments of Kütahya
