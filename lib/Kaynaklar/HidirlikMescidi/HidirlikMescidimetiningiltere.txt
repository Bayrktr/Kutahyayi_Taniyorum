It is a masjid built on a solid rock in the place called Hıdırlık Hill among the people, located in the south of Kütahya. It was built in 1243-1244 by İmadüddin Hezar Dinari, one of the Seljuk commanders, the conqueror of Kütahya. During the conquest of Kütahya, Hezar Dinari used the Hıdırlık Hill as a command center, as it was the place where the Kütahya castle was seen most clearly and the movements in it could be observed in the best way.
It is estimated that this masjid on the hill of Hıdırlık was built in order to keep the memory of the conquest of Kütahya alive.
