It was built by Ahmet Fuad Pasha, the Kütahya Governor of the time, in 1905-1906. Since the mosque was built during the reign of Sultan Abdulhamid II, it was known as the "Hamidiye Mosque" when it was opened for worship. Due to the dominant green colors in the interior decorations of the mosque, its name has changed over time to the Green Mosque among the people.
In the sources, it is stated that the architect of the mosque was Fuad Pasha and the interior decorations of the mosque were made by Painter Rıza Bey, one of the palace painters who lived in Kütahya at that time.
The mosque is surrounded by four walls, and the walls and window edges are made of masonry with cut stones. The exterior of the mosque is elegant and aesthetic just like its interior decorations.
The kiosk type minaret with balcony is the only example among Kütahya mosques. The entrance in front of the square-planned, single-domed mosque has two columns and a dome. The interior decorations of the mosque, from the dome to the ceiling, are decorated with hand-drawn work, relief, oil painting ornaments, floral motifs and geometric shapes. It is a structure worth seeing, especially with its aesthetics and decorations on the stairs to the women's mahfil.
