During the Ottoman period, muvakkithanes were traditional observatories where the movements of the sun could be observed and the Turkish style clocks were set. Prayer, iftar and sahur times in Ramadan were determined by the officials called Muvakkit by using the devices and clocks there. Those who wanted to adjust their clocks would look at the muvakkithae clock and obtain the schedules of imsakiye, iftar and prayer times from the relevant people.
Muvakkithane is in front of the old mufti building in Balıklı neighborhood of Kütahya. It was built during the reign of Sultan Mahmud II by Halil Kamil Ağa, the Governor of Kütahya, between 1831 and 1832. The longitudinal rectangular cut stone work is covered with a large eaved roof covered with tiles from the outside. The building is currently used as a trading house.
