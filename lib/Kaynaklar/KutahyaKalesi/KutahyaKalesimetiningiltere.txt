Kütahya Castle consists of three parts, an Inner Castle, Hisar, and the Lower Hisar, which was built to meet the water needs during the Ottoman period. The first two castles are thought to be Byzantine structures. The inner castle is within the walls on the steep side leading to the current Döner Casino. In the sources, it is written that the palace of the Byzantine Tekfur was located in the Inner Castle and there were water cellars. This castle was also used during the Seljuks, Germiyans, and Ottomans. Evliya Çelebi also writes that Kütahya Castle consists of 72 bastions. The castle, also known as Hisar among the people, has undergone extensive maintenance and restorations from time to time, and after it was illuminated last, it has turned into a viewing hill of the city with its location and view.
Kale-i Bala Mosque is located on the south side of the Döner Casino in the Upper Hisar section of the Castle. The mosque was built by Germiyanoğlu Süleyman Shah in 1377-1378. The mosque has been repaired and maintained at different times. The mosque, which was closed for many years, was opened for worship because the Hisar was also used as a recreation area by the public.
