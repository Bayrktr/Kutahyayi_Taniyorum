The Ottoman Government House, which is used as the Courthouse today, was built in 1907 by the Governor of Kütahya, Ahmet Fuat Pasha of Crete. The plan of this unique architectural work commissioned by Ahmet Fuad Pasha was drawn by the pasha himself, and the patterns of the tiles were drawn by Palace Painter Rıza Bey, who was sent to reside in Kütahya.
This magnificent building, covered with tiles, was used as the Kütahya Government House from 1907 to the early 1980s. The building was unused from 1983 to 1990, and after it was transferred to the Ministry of Justice as the Courthouse Building, maintenance, repair and restoration work began on the restoration of the building, which was completed in 1998 and started serving as the Courthouse in the same year.
The first floor of the building is painted with turquoise blue from the outside and the entire second floor is covered with tiles. The tiles are from the first construction date of the building in its original form. The building is one of the unique structures of Kütahya worth seeing with its architecture, tiles and decorations
