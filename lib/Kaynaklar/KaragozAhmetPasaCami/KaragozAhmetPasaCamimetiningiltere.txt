Its construction was started in 1509 by Karagöz Ahmet Pasha, who served in Kütahya as the Anatolian Governor from 1505 to 1511, during the reign of Sultan Bayezid II, the son of Mehmed the Conqueror. However, the construction of the mosque, which was left unfinished after Pasha was martyred during the Şahkulu Rebellion in 1511, was completed in 1511 by his wife Şah-ı Devran Hatun.
This mosque, made of masonry and stone, is one of the most beautiful and typical examples of the Ottoman architectural style before Mimar Sinan. It has a dome, which is the largest of the domes of Kütahya mosques, as it is seated on three twelve-cornered pulleys. With these features, the mosque is one of the most important Ottoman works in Kütahya.
