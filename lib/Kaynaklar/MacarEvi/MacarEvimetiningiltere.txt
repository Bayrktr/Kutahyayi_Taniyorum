It is an 18th century Turkish house located on Macar Street in Börekçiler Mahallesi. It is also known as the Hungarian House among the people. Lajos Kossuth (1802-1894), one of the leaders of the Hungarian independence struggle, was hosted in this house with his family between 1850 1851 and prepared the draft of the Hungarian constitution in this house.
The house, which is located in the garden and has no windows to the Hungarian street, has two floors and seven rooms. On the first floor of the museum, there is a selamlik, a Turkish dining room, and a study room next to the bedroom.
The items in the study room are Hungarian related. The upper floor is reached by a wooden staircase. There are three rooms on this floor, the main room, the family room and the memory room. The main room is the guest room, and there are musical instruments related to Kossuth, a piece of tobacco chopping sheet, etc., and a photocopy of the cover page of the Turkish grammar book written by Kossuth. There is a piano from the 18th century, porcelain dinnerware, ladies' belongings and old photos of Budapest in the family room.
This house, where Lajos KOSSTH, one of the national heroes of modern Hungary, stayed, is to be visited by Hungarian delegations coming to our country and by Hungarian diplomats working in our country on Hungarian national days.
