It is located in Börekçiler Mahallesi, it is the largest mosque in Kütahya. It is also known as Yıldırım Bayezid Han Mosque since it is mentioned as "Sultan Yıldırım Bayezid Han Mosque" in the waqf records. It is the only sultan mosque located in Kütahya. The construction of the mosque was started when Yildirim Bayezid was the governor of Kütahya (1381-1389), but it was completed by his son Musa Celebi after Bayezid was captured by Timur in the 1402 Ankara War and later died (1410)
Suleiman the Magnificent stayed in Kütahya for three days with his army on his way to the Rhodes campaign in 1522 and gave the order for the maintenance and repair of the mosque to Mimar Sinan, and the first important repair of the mosque was made by Mimar Sinan in line with this order. 
The mosque took its final shape in 1893 during the reign of Sultan Abdulhamid II, and during this last major repair, the mosque was built with a dome. In this repair, which started in 1888 and finished in 1893, the walls were demolished to the foundations and rebuilt, and the large columns inside the mosque were brought from the ancient city of Aizonai (Çavdarhisar). In the interior of the mosque, a small shadirvan and a four-column muezzin mahfili were built above the shadirvan. The main space of the mosque is covered with two side-by-side domes supported by six columns and half-domes on the sides.
The tile panel with the Kaaba depiction on the right of the protruding mihrab of the mosque, which is covered with a half dome, is worth seeing
