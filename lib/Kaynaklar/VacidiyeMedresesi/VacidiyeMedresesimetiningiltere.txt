It is located in the city center, in the Börekçiler quarter, next to the Grand Mosque. The madrasa, which was built in 1314 by one of the Germiyan Beys, Umur bin Savcı, was called the Vacidiye Madrasah because the professor, later known as Molla Vacid, taught classes here for many years and was buried here after his death. In this madrasah, which is also known as the "Iron Gate Madrasah" among the people, Molla Vacid was also busy with astronomy science, apart from religious sciences. The madrasah, which was open at first and did not have a dome, was later covered by a stone dome, and the building was protected from moisture and rain.
The building, which has been used as the Archeology Museum since 1965, has nine small rooms opening to the middle. In the museum, artifacts from the Hittite, Phrygian, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, Seljuk and Ottoman periods, starting from the Stone Age and Metal Ages, are exhibited. One of the most important artifacts in the museum is the Amazons Sarcophagus. The sarcophagus found in the excavations in Çavdarhisar- Aizonai was made with the high relief technique. It is one of the most intact of the Amazon Sarcophagi found in the world.
